# Courses

## Computational Expression 100

- An introduction to the principles of computer science with an emphasis on creative expression through the medium of a programming language. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational structures needed to solve problems and produce artifacts such as interactive games and computer-mediated art and music.

## Data Abstraction 101

- Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students create data structures and algorithms whose correctness and performance they study through proofs and experimentation. Students continue to refine their ability to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively communicates with the intended users and maintainers.

## Discrete Structures 102

- An introduction to the foundations of computer science with an emphasis on understanding the abstract structures used to represent discrete objects. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students learn the computational methods and logical principles that they need to create and manipulate discrete objects in a programming environment. Students also learn how to write, organize, and document a program's source code so that it is easily accessible to intended users of varied backgrounds.

## Programming Languages 201

- A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance, and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and efficient computer software.

## Software Engineering 203

- A human-centric study of the principles used during the engineering of high-quality software systems. In addition to examining the human behaviors and social processes undergirding software development methodologies, students participate in teams tasked with designing, developing, and delivering a significant software application for a customer.

## Software Innovation 480

- An introduction to the technical and communication skills needed to design, implement, and publicly release innovative software. In addition to establishing connections with professionals in the software field, students refine their writing abilities as they participate in online technical communities. During a weekly practical session, students use state-of-the-art tools to complete well-documented software that is useful to external collaborators, describing their systems through oral presentations and written documents featured on a web site.
