Hi! My name is Alexis Caldwell and I am a Junior at Allegheny College. I'm a Computer Science major and a Communication Arts minor. During my time here at Allegheny, I am apart of the Women's Basketball team as well as lead as Co-President of Black Girl Magic (an on campus club).

While studying here, I have worked in creative spaces such as film classes where we are taught to mix and match techniques to produce an end product that not only satisfies the assignment requirements but also entertains ourselves as well as an audience. I've also had the opportunity in my computer science classes to explore many different aspects of how coding is also influenced by the idea of creativity to get a particular job done. Currently the film and computer sciences courses I am taking, highlight the technical and professional skills to help myself and my peers to be able to be innovative in the face of a problem.
